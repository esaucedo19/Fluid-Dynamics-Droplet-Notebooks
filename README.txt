# PHYS-220-Droplet-Notebooks
 Jupyter Notebooks that contain code that analysis the behavior and angle of droplets of viscous liquid as the make contact with a barrier. These notebooks 
 analyze the relationship between the rebound and intial angles of the droplets as they make contact with the barrier. These notebooks use hisograms and 
 linear regression methods to research the results of the experiment.
